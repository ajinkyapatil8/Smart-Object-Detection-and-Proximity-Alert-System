# Smart-Object-Detection-and-Proximity-Alert-System
Smart Object Detection and Proximity Alert System.
The Smart Object Detection and Proximity Alert System is an innovative solution that utilizes YOLOv8, the latest version of the popular YOLO (You Only Look Once) model, for real-time object detection. 
This system is designed to automatically detect objects in an environment, calculate their distance from the camera, and trigger an alarm if the object is within 5 meters of the camera. This proximity alert can be crucial in applications such as security systems, autonomous vehicles, and industrial automation where timely responses are required. 
The system consists of multiple modules, including an object detection module, distance calculation module, and alarm system, all integrated to ensure seamless operation.
